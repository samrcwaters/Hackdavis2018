			<br />We are a community focused on exploring how different places make us feel different things.
			<br />Whether you're feeling happy, sad, or meh, you're never truly alone. Here's how Hellocal works:
			<br />Tell us how you're feeling, and we'll compile a list of places near you that other users have visited when they've felt the same way. </p>
